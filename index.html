                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some
                    others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static
                    typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
                    naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it
                    was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
                    JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types
                    representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                    prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is
                    inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions
                    without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to
                    declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned
                    with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
                    implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
                    explicitly typed.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of
                    variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign
                    ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case
                    sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You
                    can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some
                    examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
                <header>Declaring Variables</header>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <p>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable
                    scope below.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
                <header>Constants</header>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of
                    a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start
                    with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or
                    underscore characters.
                </p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the
                    script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                    variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                    represent a variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in
                    the same scope. For example:
                </p>
                <code
                    >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL CAUSE AN
                    ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements }</code
                >
                <p>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is
                    executed without problems.
                </p>
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Function_Declarations">
                <header>Function Declarations</header>
                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                    statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated
                        by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                        brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated
                        by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                        brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of
                    one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number)
                    multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the
                    function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the
                    value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the
                    parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
